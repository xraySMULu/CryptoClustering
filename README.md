This challenge focuses on examining price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 77 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

## What Crypto_Clustering does

In this Challenge, youâ€™ll apply your understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, you will examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.
